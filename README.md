Chilegram
===

This lab experiment was an impulsive development to try Instragr.am API and some CSS3 new techniques, adding some audio events through JS.

Libraries used:

* [jQuery Buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/)
* [Instafeed.js](http://instafeedjs.com/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)

The rest (effects, styling) are plain CSS3.

Download everything, include the project in your favorite preprocessor (in my case I use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/)) and compile.

Don't forget to check the source, mainly index.html and functions.js to link some paths and include your own [Instragram clientId](http://instagram.com/developer/).
